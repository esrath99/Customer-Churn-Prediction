# Customer-Churn-Prediction

# Objective

The objective of this project is to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company using machine learning techniques.

# Project workflow

**Dataset**: The dataset used in this project is focused on customer churn prediction for a telecommunications company. It contains 7043 rows and 21 columns

**Data Preprocessing**: Handling duplicates and missing values. Encoding categorical features into numerical form. 

**Handling Imbalanced Data**: Since the dataset has an imbalance between churn and non-churn classes, the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTETomek) is employed to balance the data
